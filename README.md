Evaluate the CNN model trained with augmented data on the test set.
Compare the results (accuracy, loss, and visualizations) of both models (with and without data augmentation).

Without Augmentation - Test Accuracy: 0.9076, Test Loss: 0.2556
With Augmentation    - Test Accuracy: 0.1845, Test Loss: 2.3678
